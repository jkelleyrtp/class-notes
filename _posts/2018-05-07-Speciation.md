## Speciation

What is a species?
- A species is a group of animals that produce live offspring with sufficiently different gene expression

### Goals
- Define and describe microevolution
- Define and describe speciation
- Describe the causes of speciation with an emphasis on evidence
- Describe how new species form
- Describe mechanisms of isolation

### What is species?
- Species consist of interbreeding populations that evolve indepdendently of other populations
- Alleles can move within speccies, but not between spcies
- What separates two populations or individuals?

### Biological species concept (BSC)
- Criterion is reproductive isolation
- If populations of organisms do not hybridize, or fail to produce fertile offspring when they do, then they are considered separate species.
- Does not explain asexual reproduction

### Morphospecies concept
- Criterion is morphological differences
- Individuals that are very similar morphologically are considered the same spcies

- but but but what?
- Things could look very similar but be entirely different

### The phylogenetic species concept
- Criterion is monophyly (taxonomic groups containing all the known decendents of a single common ancestor)
- Phylogenies are based on statistically significant differences in traits
- Species are identified by estimating the phylogeny of closely related populations and findining the smallest monophletic groups
