Sexual selection refers to the ability of an organism to choose a mate to reproduce. Sexual selection breeds "secondary sexual characteristics" that are passed down from generation to generation through selection. These traits/weapons/ornaments

We chose deer as a basic example of intrasexual selection where antlers are a secondary sex trait that are passed on through breeding. Deer with larger antlers are more competitive and reproduce more frequently, selecting for deer with the biggest and most successful antlers.
