Sexual selection refers to the ability of an organism to choose a mate to reproduce. Sexual selection breeds "secondary sexual characteristics" that are passed down from generation to generation through selection. These traits/weapons/ornaments

We chose deer as a basic example of intrasexual selection where antlers are a secondary sex trait that are passed on through breeding. Deer with larger antlers are more competitive and reproduce more frequently, selecting for deer with the biggest and most successful antlers.

### Sexual selection explain
Sexual selection occurs in two main ways: 
- Male competition
	* Males compete
- Female selection
	* Females what males to mate with.
    * Often have many choices so they can be more selective.
    * Male choice can occur if the male is putting the most work into the offspring.


Sexy sons selection:
- Sons will be sexy and attract more females when they grow up.
- Fisherian runaway selection occurs when a selected trait eventually hurts the offspring. Equilibirum between cost and benefit occur when the female peacocks can only mate with the brightest male peacocks who are not eaten.
Good genes 
- Theory explains how females find males with the best genes.

### Irish Elk
> Whichever is the case, sexual selection is the most likely explanation for why the antlers of Megaloceros were so huge. The larger and stronger the antlers, the more successful in mating the male deer would be, and the more offspring he would have â€” offspring which could inherit parental genes for large antlers.
> The Irish elk finally went extinct when the antlers became so large that the animals could no longer hold up their heads, or got entangled in the trees
