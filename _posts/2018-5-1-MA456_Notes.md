For closed piecewise smooth (non-self-intersecting) curve with counterclockwise  (positive) orientation, that

$$ \oint_{ C}^{ }  F * dr = \iint_{R}^{ }\frac{dN}{dX}-\frac{dA}{dB} dA $$

P 1026
12) 

$$ \oint_{ C}^{ } y^2dx + xydy $$

Boundary formed by:
$$ y = sqrt(x), y=0, and x=4 $$

For this line integral:
$$ \vec{F} = <M,N> $$
$$ = <y^2, xy> $$

side note: not conservative

$$ \iint_{R}^{ } y-2y  (dA) $$
$$ \int_{0}^{4}\int_{0}^{sqrt(x)} -y(dyxy) $$
or
$$ \int_{0}^{2}\int_{y^2}^{4} -y(dxdy) $$


Stokes thereom is just a special case of Green's thereom.

Let's redo as line integrals:

$$ \oint_{C_1}^{ } Mdx + Ndy + \oint_{C_2}^{ } Mdx + Ndy + \oint_{C_3}^{ } Mdx + Ndy $$

Along C_1 y = 0 (dy = 0) and x runs 0 to 4,

$$ \int_{0}^{4} y^2 dx $$ goes to 0
$$ \int_{0}^{0} xy dy $$ goes to 0

along C_2 dx = 0 so $$ \int Mdx = 0 $$
but $$\int Ndy = \int_{0}^{2} xy (dy) $$ ( x is a constant)
$$ = \int_{0}^{2} 4y dy = 8 $$
